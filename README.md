# World Weather Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilize Google's API to determine potential travel locations which match with users' weather criteria. Google's API is again used in order to generate hotel recommendations as well as to create a route between four cities which match with users' weather criteria. The resulting map includes a route, as well as pop-up markers which indicate relevant information about the travel four travel destinations including: hotel name, city, country, max temperature, and a description of the current weather.
